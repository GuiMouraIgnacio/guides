Game Development is the art of creating games. A game developer could be a programmer, a sound designer, an artist, a designer or many other roles available in the industry. We will foccus on the programming part, for obvious reasons. Originally, games were made using plain progamming languages, being needed to 'reinvent the wheel' for many common functions across different projects.

To resolve this kind of problens that game frameworks, like libGDX and OpenGL were developed. They helped game development to be a lot faster and easier, providing lots of pre-made functions and features. Even though, it was a still hard to enter the industry or understand a framework for someone wich was comming from a non-programmer background, a common case in the game development scene.

That was when game engines like Construct, Game Maker, Unity and Unreal were developed. Generally, an engine has everything that a framework had, but with a more friendly approach by using a graphic user interface (GUI) and helping with the graphic development of the game. In some cases, like Game Maker and Construct, the amount of pre-made functions are so big that people with no previous programming skills could build a game from scratch, really expanding the scene and making game development accessible for almost anyone.
